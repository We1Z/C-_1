				Assignment 2: Adventure Game With Navigation

		
		Application title: Adventure


		Instruction:
			\ If you have been asked to type in the prompt dialog,
			\ you can now type either capital or lower case words as indicated in the prompt dialog.
			\ Otherwise if you had numbers it will kill the game.
			\ Typing in "Exit" will exit out the game.
			\ Only one way to get to the end of the game. 
			


		Caveats:
			\ Whenever a gameOver is ture, the program exit and did not stay for the gameover dialog.
			\ I have a class for health stats, and intended to add items such as HP potion to recovery health.
			\ Navigation does not allow player to go to previous location
			\ Navigation currently required player to input a lot of words to match the swtich statment
			\ Items are not ready, I am working on a sword for the player to pick up and kill monsters
		
		To do list:
			\ clean up the coding
			\ Make health stats and recovery codeing works 
			\ Make sword to be picked up by player
			\ Create a better navigation system for the game ( May need to redesign the game lcoations a little bit)
			\ creating more fun object for player to interact
